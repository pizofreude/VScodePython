The calculator code is still in working progress due to removal of parser module for python.

The parser module is replaced by ast module Abstract Syntax Trees:
https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/ast.html#module-ast

eval function via ast module must be solved as the current solution delivers error.
No evaluation of calculation has been successfully made.
